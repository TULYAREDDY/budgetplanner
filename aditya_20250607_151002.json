1. **Mutual Funds/ETFs:** Allocate a portion to equity mutual funds or ETFs for long-term growth (e.g., ₹20,000 - ₹30,000 monthly).
2. **Debt Instruments:** Consider debt mutual funds or government bonds for stability (e.g., ₹10,000 monthly).
3. **Fixed Deposits/Recurring Deposits:** If risk-averse, allocate a smaller portion to FDs or RDs.
