3. **Car Loan:** Since the duration is shorter, focus on making extra payments towards the principal amount of the car loan whenever possible to reduce the overall interest paid and shorten the loan term.
4. **Detailed Bank Statement Review:** Use bank statement insights (see sections 6 & 7) to identify and categorize all your spending, allowing for targeted reduction efforts. Look for recurring subscriptions or non-essential expenses that can be cut."
