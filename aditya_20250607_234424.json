Fixed Expenses (Rent + Groceries + EMIs): ₹13,500 + ₹4,500 + ₹43,391.16 + ₹10,427.78 = ₹71,818.94
Remaining Income (Available for Discretionary Spending & Savings): ₹100,000 - ₹71,818.94 = ₹28,181.06

Negotiate rent if possible and consider lower cost housing options after loan reduction, or increasing salary.

*   **PPF (Public Provident Fund):** Tax-advantaged long-term savings option with guaranteed returns.

Given the current bank statement shows a very low closing balance, prioritize building this fund by allocating a significant portion of your available income (₹28,181.06) to it.

*   **Review Account Fees:** Ensure you are not paying unnecessary bank charges. Look for accounts with minimal fees.
*   **Consider Auto-Sweep Facility:** Automatically transfer excess funds from your savings account to a fixed deposit for higher returns."
