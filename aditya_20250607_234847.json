1. **Prioritize Debt Reduction:** Any extra funds should be used to pay down the Car Loan faster, as it has a higher interest rate.
2. **Mutual Funds (SIP):** Allocate a portion of savings (e.g., ₹5,000-₹10,000) to Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in diversified equity mutual funds for long-term growth.
3. **Index Funds:** Consider investing in low-cost index funds that track a specific market index (e.g., Nifty 50) for broad market exposure.
4. **Debt Funds:** Allocate a smaller portion (e.g., ₹2,000-₹5,000) to debt funds for lower-risk, stable returns. These can provide a buffer in volatile times.
5. **Tax Saving Investments:** Maximize tax saving investments u/s 80C such as ELSS funds, PPF etc."
