Fixed Expenses: ₹43,391.16 (Home Loan) + ₹10,427.78 (Car Loan) + ₹13,500 (Rent) + ₹4,500 (Groceries) = ₹71,818.94
Remaining Income: ₹100,000 - ₹71,818.94 = ₹28,181.06
This indicates approximately 28.18% of your income is available for discretionary spending, savings, and investments. However, this is before accounting for other essential expenses. A more detailed budget breakdown is needed to identify areas for potential savings."
