Total Fixed Expenses (Rent + Groceries + EMI): ₹4,500 + ₹13,500 + ₹43,391.16 + ₹10,427.78 = ₹71,818.94
Remaining Income: ₹100,000 - ₹71,818.94 = ₹28,181.06

This analysis indicates that approximately 71.82% of your income is currently allocated to fixed expenses. The remaining ₹28,181.06 must cover all other variable expenses, savings, and investments. Further review is needed to determine the proportion spent on discretionary spending and potential areas for optimization."

2.  **Housing:** While rent is a high priority, research if alternative housing options with lower costs are available if needed.
3.  **Loans:** Explore refinancing options for Home Loan and Car Loan to potentially secure lower interest rates and reduce monthly payments. Prioritize the car loan due to the higher interest rate.
4.  **Identify Discretionary Spending:** Analyze bank statements for recurring discretionary expenses (e.g., dining out, entertainment, subscriptions) and identify areas where spending can be reduced. Set realistic budgets for these categories."

1.  **Mutual Funds (SIP):** Start a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) in diversified equity mutual funds to build long-term wealth. Consider a mix of large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap funds based on your risk tolerance.
2.  **Debt Instruments:** Invest in fixed deposits or debt mutual funds to balance your portfolio and provide stability.
3.  **PPF (Public Provident Fund):** Consider investing in PPF for tax benefits and long-term savings. The interest rate is attractive and guaranteed by the government.
4.  **Prioritize Debt Reduction:** While investing is important, aggressively paying down high-interest debt (like the car loan) can significantly improve cash flow in the long run. Consider allocating a portion of your investment funds towards accelerating debt repayment."

Target Emergency Fund Size: Estimate 3-6 months of total expenses (including EMIs). Start small and gradually increase the fund amount.

Prioritize building the emergency fund before making significant investments."

3.  **Insurance:** Ensure adequate life and health insurance coverage to protect yourself and your family from unforeseen events. Review your policies regularly.

Significant debit transactions occur via 'NEFT Transfer' and 'UPI Transfer'. Categorize these transactions to understand where the money is being spent.

'ATM Withdrawal' also contributes to the outflow. Minimize cash withdrawals and track cash spending to better manage expenses."

The substantial closing balance reduction (from ₹26,742 to ₹2,607.02) suggests overspending during the statement period. Implement a detailed budgeting system to track income and expenses effectively.

Review 'UPI Transfer' details. This category is very broad and needs further dissection to pinpoint spending patterns."

3.  **Automated Bill Payment:** Set up automated bill payments to avoid late fees and maintain a good credit score.
4. **Review existing account:** Based on the transaction analysis and low ending balance, you may want to review if the current account type (savings) is optimal. If many transactions are for business or heavy usage, a current account may provide features with more value."
