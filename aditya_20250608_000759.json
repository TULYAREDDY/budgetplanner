- **Identify Discretionary Spending:** Track all expenditures for a month to identify areas where spending can be reduced (e.g., dining out, entertainment).

- **Index Funds:** A low-cost option for equity exposure.
- **Fixed Deposits/Recurring Deposits:** Suitable for low-risk investments and building the emergency fund."

- **Bill Payment Automation:** Utilize your bank's bill payment service to automate recurring payments and avoid late fees."
