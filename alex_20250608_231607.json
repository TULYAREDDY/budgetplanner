*   **Eliminate or Reduce Cosmetics Expenses:** This is a low-priority expense. Consider using cheaper alternatives or reducing the frequency of purchases.
*   **Negotiate Loan Interest Rates:** Explore refinancing options for both the home loan and car loan to potentially lower interest rates.
*   **Consider Selling Car:** If the car is not absolutely necessary for work, selling the car could alleviate a significant financial burden. Explore alternatives like public transport or ride-sharing.
*   **Seek Alternatives:** If Rent is too high explore sharing accommodations"

*   **Start with Low-Risk Investments:** Consider liquid mutual funds or fixed deposits to build a safety net.

*   **Retirement Planning:** Consider investing in PPF or NPS for tax benefits and long-term retirement security.
*   **Focus on debt repayment first**: Given that you are in debt, any surplus should first go towards debt repayment to reduce the high interest burden. "
