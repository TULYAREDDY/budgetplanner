Once you have a surplus, consider low-risk investments such as liquid mutual funds or fixed deposits to build capital. Prioritize paying down the high-interest car loan. Avoid high-risk investments until your debt is under control and emergency fund is established. Post financial stability, consider debt mutual funds."

Once you are in a surplus position, aim to save 3-6 months of essential living expenses in a highly liquid account. This fund should cover unforeseen expenses like job loss or medical emergencies. Start with small, consistent contributions."

Once you have a surplus, consult a financial advisor to create a diversified investment portfolio tailored to your risk tolerance and goals. Consider investments in equities, bonds, and real estate (after debt is managed and emergency fund is fully funded). Review your plan annually."
