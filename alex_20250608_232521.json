- **Renegotiate Loan Terms:** Explore options to refinance your home and car loans for lower interest rates or longer terms.  This could significantly reduce monthly payments, but be mindful of the total interest paid over the loan's lifespan.
- **Increase Income:**  Consider side hustles, freelancing, or seeking a higher-paying job to supplement your income."

Once you achieve a surplus, start with low-risk investments like debt mutual funds or recurring deposits. Consult a financial advisor for personalized recommendations based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Focus on paying down high interest debt first as this provides a guaranteed rate of return."

- **Credit Card with Rewards:** If you use a credit card, choose one with rewards that align with your spending habits (e.g., cashback on groceries or fuel). But be sure to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid interest charges.
- **Consider debt consolidation loans:** Look into consolidating your home loan and car loan into a single loan, potentially with a lower interest rate. Always compare offers and understand the terms."
