- **Food:** Explore cheaper grocery options, reduce eating out.
- **Housing:** While rent is a fixed cost, explore if a slightly cheaper, but still acceptable option is available for the future.
- **Car Loan:** Consider refinancing the car loan to a lower interest rate if possible. Explore public transport options, or carpooling to reduce fuel/maintenance costs. Evaluate the necessity of the car itself; could downsizing or selling it and using ride-sharing be an option?"
