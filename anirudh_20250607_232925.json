Since we need to analyze your risk tolerance and financial goals based on the bank statement, I can suggest that you start with Low-risk options such as Debt Mutual funds or High-interest saving accounts. Post the transaction pattern analysis, we can then revisit and make more personalised investment recommendations (e.g., Stocks, Index Funds, Real Estate). A systematic Investment Plan (SIP) would be a good starting point."

Potentially explore credit cards with cashback or reward programs, used responsibly, to maximize benefits from your spending. Based on transaction details, if you frequently send money internationally, compare money transfer fees across different banks to ensure you are using the most cost-effective option. If you are maintaining high minimum balances with no return, talk to your bank regarding higher interest savings accounts."
