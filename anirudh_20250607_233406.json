Aim to save 3-6 months' worth of living expenses in a highly liquid and easily accessible account (e.g., savings account or money market fund).  Given your current financial situation, dedicate a portion of your remaining funds each month (even if it's small) to build this safety net.

Consider opening a high-yield savings account for your emergency fund. Explore credit cards with cashback or rewards programs that align with your spending habits, but be sure to pay off the balance in full each month to avoid accumulating debt. Consolidating debt to a lower interest credit card (if feasible) can reduce monthly outgo."
