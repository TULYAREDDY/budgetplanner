Specifically, your declared expenses include groceries (₹5,000), rent (₹15,000), cab (₹2,700), and movie (₹600). Additionally, you have two EMI payments: a Home Loan (₹4,339.12) and a Car Loan (₹4,171.11). This results in a severe budget deficit. Immediate and drastic action is required to address this unsustainable financial situation. Further investigation may be required to uncover additional income sources."

*   **Housing:** Rent is disproportionately high compared to your income. Explore significantly cheaper housing options or consider sharing accommodation.
*   **Transportation:** The cab expense (₹2,700) is substantial. Switch to public transportation, cycling, or walking wherever possible. Prioritize essential trips only.
*   **Entertainment:** Eliminate non-essential entertainment expenses like movies (₹600) until your financial situation improves.
*   **Groceries:** The amount spent on groceries equals to your monthly salary which seems to be an incorrect amount. Double check this expense and aim to reduce food expenses by planning meals, cooking at home, and avoiding eating out."

Prioritize paying down high-interest debt first (likely the Car Loan due to the higher interest rate). Ensure you have direct deposits setup for faster transaction and payments."

Compare different accounts for their fees and minimum balance requirements. Avoid overdraft fees by carefully managing your account balance. Also, avoid using Credit Cards which might worsen the situation by further accumulating debt. "
